/**
 * AGE GROUP ENUMERATION
 * ======================
 * This categorizes users into age ranges for nutritional requirements.
 * 
 * Why group by age?
 * - Different ages need different amounts of nutrients
 * - A 3-year-old needs less calcium than a 15-year-old
 * - Growing adolescents have different needs than young children
 * - Makes it easier to set appropriate thresholds
 * 
 * These age groups are based on standard nutritional guidelines
 * from organizations like the USDA and WHO.

    // How we use age groups:
    // 
    // 1. When a user registers, we calculate their age group from their age
    // 2. We store different nutrient thresholds for each age group in the database
    // 3. When analyzing diet, we compare their intake to their age group's requirements
    // 4. Recommendations are tailored to their age group's needs
    // 5. Admins can configure different thresholds for each age group
    // 
    // Example:
    // - User is 10 years old → AGE_9_13
    // - System looks up calcium requirement for AGE_9_13 → 1300 mg/day
    // - User's intake is 800 mg/day
    // - System calculates: 800/1300 = 61.5% (MODERATE deficiency)
    // - System recommends calcium-rich foods appropriate for 10-year-olds
    // 
    // This ensures every user gets age-appropriate guidance!
